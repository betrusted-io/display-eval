# Display Evaluation

Some code for bitbanging GPIOs on the Rpi so that various 
display solutions can be evaluated for readability, power
refresh rate, etc. 

Various branches will support different display types.
Since this is eval code, the code is mean to be basically
write-once code, but it's checked into github so that
later on if an eval needs to be reproduced on hardware
the construct can be rebuilt.
